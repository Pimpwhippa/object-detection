# object-detection

Customize an objects detector using a Deep Neural Network (Darknet) and OpenCV. 

Trained a custom YOLOv3 model to build a detector with Python that can detect snakes, fire, and guns for preventive security procedures. 
The detector serves as an AI extension on the company’s surveillance robot product.

• Train, test and fine-tune the deep learning model YOLOv3 (You-Only-Look-Once) to reach the published mAP (mean average precision)

• Write a script for reproduction for the data preprocessing. Scripts are in reproduce_code/
    coco_to_yolo_comeback_cp.sh,
    imagenet_allprocess_sshsave.sh,
    firestart.sh
